The name that charms our fears , That bids our sorrows cease; ’Tis music in the sinner’s ears , 'Tis life , and health , and peace. \rHe speaks , and , listening to His voice , New life the dead receive , The mournful , broken hearts rejoice , The humble poor believe. \rHe breaks the power of cancelled sin , He sets the prisoner free; His blood can make the foulest clean , His blood availed for me. \rSee all your sins on Jesus laid: The Lamb of God was slain , His soul was once an offering made For every soul of man."

 Millions more Thou ready art To save , and to forgive; Every soul and every heart Father , now accept of mine , Which now , through Christ , I offer Thee; Tell me now , in love divine , That Thou hast pardoned me.

 He hath our salvation wrought , He our captive souls hath bought , He hath reconciled to God , He hath washed us in His blood.
 We are now His lawful right , Walk as children of the light; We shall soon obtain the grace , Pure in heart , to see His face.
 We shall gain our calling’s prize; After God we all shall rise , Filled with joy , and love , and peace , Perfected in holiness.

 With mercy’s mildest grace , He governs all our race In wisdom , righteousness , and love: Who to Messiah fly Shall find redemption nigh , And all His great salvation prove.
 Hail , Saviour , Prince of peace! Thy kingdom shall increase , Till all the world Thy glory see , And righteousness abound As the great deep profound , And fill the earth with purity.

MY song is love unknown; My Saviour’s love to me; Love to the loveless shown , That they might lovely be. O who am I That for my sake , My Lord should take Frail flesh  ,and die?
 He came from His blessed Throne , Salvation to bestow: But men made strange , and none The longed-for Christ would know. But O , my Friend! My Friend indeed , Who at my need His life did spend!
 Sometimes they strew His way , And His sweet praises sing; Resounding all the day , Hosannas to their King. Then: Crucify! Is all their breath , And for His death They thirst and cry.
 Why , what hath my Lord done? What makes this rage and spite? He made the lame to run , He gave the blind their sight. Sweet injuries! Yet they at these Themselves displease , And ’gainst Him rise.
 They rise and needs will have My dear Lord made away; A murderer they save; The Prince of Life they slay. Yet cheerful He To suffering goes , That He His foes From thence might free.
 In life , no house , no home My Lord on earth might have; In death , no friendly tomb But what a stranger gave. What may I say? Heaven was His home; But mine the tomb Wherein He lay.
 Here might I stay and sing , No story so divine; Never was love , dear King , Never was grief like Thine! This is my Friend , In whose sweet praise I all my days Could gladly spend.

JESUS , who lived above the sky , Came down to be a man and die; And in the Bible we may see How very good He used to be.
 He went about-He was so kindTo cure poor people who were blind; And many who were sick and lame , He pitied them and did the same
 And more than that , He told them , too , The things that God would have them do; And was so gentle and so mild , He would have listened to a child.
 But such a cruel death He died! He was hung up and crucified; And those kind hands that did such good , They nailed them to a cross of wood.

 Jesus , I will trust Thee , pondering Thy ways , Full of love and mercy all Thine earthly days: Sinners gathered round Thee , lepers sought Thy face , None too vile or loathsome for a saviour’s grace.
 Jesus , I will trust Thee , trust Thee without doubt; Whosoever cometh Thou wilt not cast out: Faithful is Thy promise , precious is Thy blood— These my soul’s salvation , Thou my Savior God.

 Though few and small and weak your bands , Strong in your Captain’s strength , Go to the conquest of all lands; All must be His at length.
 O fear not , faint not , halt not now; Quit you like men , be strong;nTo Christ shall every nation bow , And sing with you this song:
 Uplifted are the gates of brass; The bars of iron yield; Behold the King of Glory pass! The Cross hath won the field.

 Sins unnumbered I confess , Of exceeding sinfulness; Sins against Thyself alone , Only to Omniscience known;
 Deafness to Thy whispered calls , Rashness midst remembered falls , Transient fears beneath the rod , Treacherous trifling with my God;
 Tasting that the Lord is good , Pining then for poisoned food; At the fountains of the skies Craving creaturely supplies;
 Worldly cares at worship-time; Grovelling aims in works sublime; Pride , when God is passing by; Sloth , when souls in darkness die;
 Chilled devotions , changed desires , Quenched corruption’s earlier fires: Sins like these my heart deceive , Thee , who only know’st them , grieve.

 Woke to holy labours fresh With the plague-spot in my flesh; Angel seemed to human sight , Stood a leper in Thy light.

YE neighbors and friends of Jesus draw near: His love condescends by titles so dear To call and invite you His triumph to prove , And freely delight you in Jesus’s love.
 The Shepherd who died His sheep to redeem; On every side are gathered to Him The weary and burdened , the reprobate race; And wait to be pardoned through Jesus’s grace.
 The blind are restored through Jesus’s name , They see their dear Lord , and follow the Lamb; The halt they are walking , and running their race; The dumb they are talking of Jesus’s grace.
 The deaf hear His voice and comforting Word , It bids them rejoice in Jesus their Lord: Thy sins are forgiven , accepted thou art; They listen , and heaven springs up in their heart
 The lepers from all their spots are made clean , The dead by His call are raised from their sin; In Jesus’s compassion the sick find a cure , And gospel salvation is preached to the poor.
 They seek Him and find: they ask and receive The Friend of mankind , who bids them believe: On Jesus they venture , His gift they embrance , And forcibly enter His kingdom of grace.
 O Jesus , ride on till all are subdued , Thy mercy make known , and sprinkle Thy blood; Display Thy salvation , and teach the new song To every nation , and people , and tongue. Amen.

 Loosed from my God , and far removed , Long have I wandered to and fro , O’er earth in endless circles roved , Nor found whereon to rest below: Back to my God at last I fly , For O , the waters still are high!
 Selfish pursuits , and nature’s maze , The things of earth , for Thee I leave; Put forth Thy hand , thy hand of grace , Into the ark of love receive , Take this poor fluttering soul to rest , And lodge it , Saviour , in Thy breast

 True , ’tis a strait and thorny road , And mortal spirits tire and faint; But they forget the mighty God That feeds the strength of every saint.
 O mighty God , Thy matchless power Is ever new and ever young , And firm endures , while endless years Their everlasting circles run.
 From Thee , the over flowing spring , Our souls shall drink a fresh supply; While such as trust their native strength Shall melt away , and drop , and die.
 Swift as the eagle cuts the air , We’ll mount aloft to Thine abode; On wings of love our souls shall fly , Nor tire along the heavenly road

 See on the mountain-top The standard of your God! In Jesu’s name I lift it up , All stained with hallowed blood. His standard-bearer , I To all the nations call , Let all to Jesu’s cross draw nigh! He bore the cross for all.
 Go up with Christ your Head , Your Captain’s footsteps see; Follow your Captain , and be led To certain victory. All power to Him is given , He ever reigns the same; Salvation , happiness , and heaven Are all in Jesu’s name.
 Only have faith in God; In faith your foes assail , Not wrestling against flesh and blood , But all the powers of hell; From thrones of glory driven , By flaming vengeance hurled , They throng the air , and darken heaven , And thou shalt reign with Me!

 Why should I complain of want or distress , Temptation or pain? He told me no less; The heirs of salvation , I know from His word. Through much tribulation must follow their Lord.
 Since all that I meet shall work for my good , The bitter is sweet , the medicine food; Though painful at present , ‘twill cease before long; And then , O how pleasant the conqueror’s song!

 We have no abiding city here , But seek a city out of sight; Thither our steady course we steer , Aspiring to the plains of light , Jerusalem , the saints’ abode , Whose founder is the living God.
 Patient the appointed race to run , This weary world we cast behind; From strength to strength we travel on The new Jerusalem to find; Our labour this , our only aim , To find the new Jerusalem.
 Through Thee , who all our sins hast borne , Freely and graciously forgiven , With songs to Zion we return , Contending for our native heaven; That palace of our glorious King , We find it nearer while we sing.
 Raised by the breath of love divine , We urge our way with strength renewed; The church of the first-born to join , We travel to the mount of God , With joy upon our heads arise , And meet our Captain in the skies.

 There from the music round about me stealing I fain would learn the new and holy song , And find at last , beneath Thy trees of healing , The life for which I long.

 How purely hath thy speech come down From man’s primeval youth! How grandly hath thine empire grown Of freedom , love and truth!
 How gleam thy watch fires-through the night With never-fainting ray! How rise thy towers , serene and bright To meet the dawning day!
 In vain the surge’s angry shock , In vain the drifting sands; Unharmed upon the eternal Rock The eternal City stands.

FOR all the saints , who from their labours rest , Who thee by faith before the world confessed , Thy Name , O Jesus , be forever blest. Alleluia!
 Thou wast their Rock , their Fortress and their Might; Thou , Lord , their Captain in the well fought fight; Thou , in the darkness drear , their one true Light. Alleluia!
 O may thy soldiers , faithful , true , and bold , Fight as the saints who nobly fought of old , And win , with them the victor’s crown of gold. Alleluia!

 And when the strife is fierce , the warfare long , Steals on the ear the distant triumph song , And hearts are brave , again , and arms are strong. Alleluia!
 The golden evening brightens in the west; Soon , soon to faithful warriors comes their rest; Sweet is the calm of paradise the blessed. Alleluia!
 But lo! there breaks a yet more glorious day; The saints triumphant rise in bright array; The King of glory passes on His way. Alleluia!

I long for the joy of that glorious time , The sweetest and brightest and best , When the dear little children of every clime Shall crowd to His arms and be blest.

 How kind was our Saviour to bid those children welcome! But there are many thousands who have never heard His Name; Dear savior hear us when we pray’ That they may hear thee to them say: “Suffer the little children to come unto Me.”

 Praise we the great of heart and mind , The singers sweetly gifted. Whose music like a mighty wind The souls of men uplifted.
 Praise we the peaceful men of skill Who builded homes of beauty , And , rich in art , made richer still The brotherhood of duty.
 Praise we the glorious names we know; And they-whose names have perished , Lost in the haze of long ago In silent love be cherished.
 In peace their sacred ashes rest , Fulfilled their day’s endeavour; They blest the earth , and they are blest Of God and man , for ever.
