BELOVED , let us love : Love is of God
In God alone hath love Its true abode.
Beloved , let us love : For they who love , They only are His sons , Born from above.
Beloved , let us love : For love Is rest , And He who loveth not , Abides unblest.
Beloved , let us love : In love is light , And He who loveth not , Dwelleth in night
Beloved , let us love : For only thus Shall we behold that God Who loveth us.

    lyrics: """
STAND up , stand up for Jesus , Ye soldiers of the cross
Lift high His royal banner , It must not suffer loss. From victory unto victory His army shall He lead , Till every foe is vanquished , And Christ is Lord indeed.
Stand up , stand up for Jesus , The trumpet call obey
Forth to the mighty conflict , In this His glorious day. Ye that are brave now serve Him Against unnumbered foes Let courage rise with danger , And strength to strength oppose.
Stand up , stand up for Jesus Stand in His strength alone : The arm of flesh will fail you
Ye dare not trust your own. Put on the Christian\'s armour , And watching unto prayer , Where duty calls , or danger , Be never wanting there.
Stand up , stand up for Jesus The strife will not be long
This day the noise of battle , The next the victor\'s song. To Him that overcometh A crown of life shall be He with the King of Glory Shall reign eternally.
